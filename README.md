This FPS Booster can improve FPS by 50% on games using DirectX, OpenGL, etc. It applies a GPU algorithm similar to that of Nvidia's DLSS without needing an RTX card with DLSS on hardware. This means through a software based application, the AI algorithm can make you run games at a lower resolution then upscales resolution in order to get the best quality and fps. Open the zip file and extract it anywhere, then open README to get started.
